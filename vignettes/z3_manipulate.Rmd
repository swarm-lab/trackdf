Under the hood, a track table is a data frame with a few extra bells and 
whistles. Therefore, you can manipulate a track table in the same way you would
a `base::data.frame`, `tibble::tibble`, or `data.table::data.table` (depending
on the data frame class you used as a base for your track table). Anything that
you can do with one of these three data frame classes can be done the same way 
with a track table. 

There are, however, a few additional things that are specific to track tables 
and we will review them in this vignette. 

But first, let's load a track table that is provided with `trackdf`: 

```{r}
library(trackdf)

data("tracks")
print(tracks, max = 10 * ncol(tracks))
```

This track table contains the GPS coordinates of two goats foraging through the 
Tsaobis Nature Park in Namibia, sometimes in 2015.

## 3.1 - Basic information about the track table

In addition to the usual information that you can ask about a data frame (e.g., 
the number of rows and columns, the class of each column, etc), you can access 
additional information about the content of a track table. 

First, you can check whether an object is indeed a track table as follows:

```{r}
is_track(tracks)
```

You can also check whether the track table contains geographic coordinates or 
not as follows:

```{r}
is_geo(tracks)
```

You can find out the number of different tracks included in the track table as 
follows: 

```{r}
n_tracks(tracks)
```

Finally, you can retrieve the dimensionality (2D or 3D) of the track table as 
follows: 

```{r}
n_dims(tracks)
```

## 3.2 - Accessing data

Accessing and modifying the different parts (rows, columns, elements) of a track 
table is similar to accessing and modifying the different parts of the 
underlying data frame. We will, therefore, not discuss this topic further as it 
is something that you should already be very familar with. 

Note, however, that different data frame classes may do thing slightly 
differently from each other. Make sure to know what class is used with the track 
tables you are working with. For instance, the track table that we loaded for 
this tutorial if of class `data.frame`, as indicated in the 6th line of the 
print out of the track table: 

```{r}
print(tracks, max = 10 * ncol(tracks))
```

## 3.3 - Accessing the projection information of a track table

One particularity of track tables over regular data frames is that they can 
store geographic data explicitly and perform projection operations to change 
their coordinate reference system if necessary. 

In order to access the coordinate reference system (or projection) of a track 
table containing geographic data, you simply need to execute the following 
command: 

```{r}
projection(tracks)
```

This returns an object of class `crs` which is a list consisting of an `input` 
object (usually the character string that you have entered in `track` under the 
`proj` parameter), and a `wkt` object which is an automatically generated 
[WKT 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_coordinate_reference_systems)
representation of the coordinate reference system. 

You can modify in place the projection of a track table as follows. This will 
automatically convert the x and y coordinates contained in the track table to 
the appropriate projection system: 

```{r}
projection(tracks) <- "+proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524056 +lon_0=7.43958333 +ellps=bessel +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +towgs84=674.374,15.056,405.346 +units=m +k_0=1 +no_defs"
print(tracks, max = 10 * ncol(tracks))
```
And back to the original projection: 

```{r}
projection(tracks) <- "+proj=longlat" 
print(tracks, max = 10 * ncol(tracks))
```

If you prefer not to modify the original object, you can create a new one with 
the new projection using the`project` function as follows:

```{r}
tracks_somerc <- project(tracks, "+proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524056 +lon_0=7.43958333 +ellps=bessel +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +towgs84=674.374,15.056,405.346 +units=m +k_0=1 +no_defs")
print(tracks_somerc, max = 10 * ncol(tracks))
```

## 3.4 - Combining track tables

Combining track tables requires a bit of caution. Indeed, traditional methods to 
combine data frames (e.g., `base::rbind`, `data.table::rbindlist`, or 
`dplyr::bind_rows`) will successfully bind together multiple track tables but 
they will not check whether these track tables are compatible with each other. 
For instance, they will not check that the coordinates are using the same 
coordinate reference system or that the time stamps are all in the same time 
zone. 

In order to ensure that different track tables can be combined without creating 
problems down the analysis pipeline, `trackdf` provides its own method to bind 
multiple track tables together: `bind_tracks`. 

To demonstrate how `bind_tracks` works, let's first create 3 track tables, 2 
that are compatible with each other, and 1 that is not. 

```{r}
raw1 <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/gps/02.csv", package = "trackdf"))
raw2 <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/gps/03.csv", package = "trackdf"))
raw3 <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/video/01.csv", package = "trackdf"))

track1 <- track(x = raw1$lon, y = raw1$lat, t = paste(raw1$date, raw1$time), 
                id = 1, proj = "+proj=longlat", tz = "Africa/Windhoek")
track2 <- track(x = raw2$lon, y = raw2$lat, t = paste(raw2$date, raw2$time), 
                id = 2, proj = "+proj=longlat", tz = "Africa/Windhoek")
track3 <- track(x = raw3$x, y = raw3$y, t = raw3$frame, id = raw3$track_fixed, 
                origin = "2019-03-24 12:55:23", period = "0.04S", 
                tz = "America/New_York")
```

If you try to combine the 3 track tables using `bind_tracks`, an error will be 
thrown to let you know that they are not compatible with each other:

```{r, error=TRUE}
bounded_tracks <- bind_tracks(track1, track2, track3)
```

Compare this to what happens with one of the traditional binding methods:

```{r}
bounded_tracks <- rbind(track1, track2, track3)
print(bounded_tracks, max = 10 * ncol(bounded_tracks))
```

Here, the tracks tables are combined with each other despite having different 
coordinate reference systems and time zones. Using `bind_tracks` instead ensures 
that this cannot happen.

## 3.5 - Tidyverse

Track tables are compatible with (most) of the functions from the 
["tidyverse"](https://www.tidyverse.org/). For instance, you can use all the 
[`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) verbs to filter, mutate, group, etc., a 
track table, in the same way you would do with a `tibble::tibble` or a 
`base::data.frame`. As long as the result of the operation that you are applying 
to a track table does not affect its fundamental structure (see vignette 
["Building a track table"](z2_build.html)), the output that you will get will 
remain a track table with its specific attributes. 

For instance, here is how to filter a track table to keep only the observations 
between 2 specific time stamps: 

```{r}
library(dplyr)

filtered_tracks <- tracks %>%
  filter(., t >= as.POSIXct("2015-09-10 07:01:00", tz = "Africa/Windhoek"),
         t <= as.POSIXct("2015-09-10 07:11:00 CAT", tz = "Africa/Windhoek"))
print(filtered_tracks, max = 10 * ncol(filtered_tracks))
```

## 3.6 - Plotting

You can use any plotting method accepting a data frame of any class to represent 
the data in a track table.

Here is an example using [`ggplot2`]{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/}:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = tracks) +
  aes(x = x, y = y, color = id) +
  geom_path() +
  coord_map()
```
